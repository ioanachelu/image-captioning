# Image Captioning

A Tensorflow implementation of the automatic generation of descriptions for images based on the paper:

"Show and Tell: Lessons learned from the 2015 MSCOCO Image Captioning
Challenge." by Oriol Vinyals, Alexander Toshev, Samy Bengio, Dumitru Erhan.

## System requirements

 - Python3.5
 - NLKT
    
        $ sudo pip install -U nltk
        
## Steps to run project:

 * create a new conda env; this is recommended because we use tensorflow version 1.0 and we do not want to interfere with
 other versions you might have installed for other projects and cause crashes

        $ conda create -n qmodnet python=3.5 anaconda
    
 * provided you are located in the root directory ```image_captioning```, just run:

        $ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
